# software_process

This is my personal class notes for software process.

I **cannot** guarantee the completeness and correctness because of my frequently lucid dreaming during the class. In fact, I didn't listen to a single word until he announced the midterm exam, so there's **at most half of** the content. Thus I strongly advise you to read the slides personally. In case of any discrepancy or inconsistency between the note and the slides, the latter shall prevail.

Please commit an issue if you got any advice or willing to contribute to it
